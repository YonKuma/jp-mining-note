!!! Foreword

    This project is a fork of the outstanding JP Mining Note project created by
    Aquafina-Water-Bottle. Aquafina went silent a couple of months ago, and in
    the meantime, bugs have started to creep into this project as other supporting
    software has received updates.

    The purpose of this fork is to provide bugfixes for JPMN until Aquafina returns
    to take over maintenance again. I don't have the time or expertise to
    continue adding features to the note, but hopefully I can keep it functional.

    Version 0.11.0.5 has been released alongside this fork. It resolves a bug that
    prevented pitch accent information from being displayed correctly after a recent
    AJTJapanese update. [Click here](updating.md) for instructions on updating.

    When Aquafina returns and resumes maintenance of the main project, I will close
    down this fork. The documentation for the original project can be found [here](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/).
